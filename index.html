        Kawasaki's origins go back to 1878, when Shozo Kawasaki established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard in Tokyo. Eighteen years later, in 1896, it was incorporated as Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd.
        While a bit less reliable than the other big three Japanese brands, Kawasaki is still a dependable choice. Their popular Ninja and KLR models are a good choice if you're looking for a reliable, fun ride and their popularity makes repairs more affordable too.   </p></div>
